## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Install or Upgrade

Follow the [Flow CLI installation guide](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli/install/) for instructions on how to install or upgrade the CLI.

## üí• Breaking Changes

### Configuration Format

The default configuration format (i.e. the contents of `flow.json`) has been updated.
It is now unified to work with all CLI commands. 
The new format is not backwards compatible with the old format.

If needed, you can generate a new configuration file with the `flow init` command.

Read more about the new configuration format in the [documentation](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli/configuration).

### Updated: `flow blocks get`

The `--latest`, `--id` and `--height` have been removed.

Instead, use the new argument syntax:

```sh
# get latest block
flow blocks get latest

# get a block by ID
flow blocks get 6bb0e0fceef9225a3cf9ceb6df9a31bd0063e6ee8e8dd7fdd93b831783243cd3

# get a block by height
flow blocks get 28329914
```

Read more about this change in the [documentation](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli/get-blocks).

### Removed: `flow keys decode`

The `flow keys decode` command has been temporarily removed due to a bug that requires further investigation.

### Removed: `flow keys save`

The `flow keys save` command has been removed in favour of an upcoming `flow accounts add` command.
