# CLI Developer Update v17.0

New CLI version introduces big improvements to the code base and allows 
other developers to import `flowcli` package to be used in their projects.

Configuration was unified and you can now use the new configuration format for all the commands.

Commands and flags were adapted for more consistency.
New [documentation](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli/) covering all the commands you can use. 

Release also includes CLI design guidelines which you 
can read in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTIRUBUTING.md) document

Improved deprecation warnings. Commands now include deprecated flags which instruct you 
how to use the command with new flags.

```
‚ùå Command Error: ‚ö†Ô∏è  No longer supported: use command argument.

Improved Error reporting with suggestions how to fix the error.

```
